# Node-RED flow for solar management with Home Assistant

This flow uses the Sungrow Modbus solution provided by mkaiser https://github.com/mkaiser/Sungrow-SHx-Inverter-Modbus-Home-Assistant - if you have a different inverter you will need to reconfigure the sensors to suit.

A Solcast hobbyist account is used to get solar forecasts.

I use the VS Code add-on to review and create the needed files in HA
